      "additionalNotes": "A Ruby library for parsing, validating, and generating Package URLs (PURLs) as defined by the PURL specification\n\npurl is a Ruby library for working with Package URLs (PURLs) - the standard way to identify software packages across different ecosystems. It handles parsing, validation, and generation of PURLs for 37 package types.\n\nWhat makes this gem useful is the bidirectional registry URL conversion - you can convert PURLs to registry URLs (like turning pkg:gem/rails@7.0.0 into https://rubygems.org/gems/rails) and parse registry URLs back into PURLs. It also includes a CLI tool with JSON output, security advisory lookups, and passes 100% of the official PURL spec test suite.\n\nYour support helps me maintain this library and add support for new package ecosystems as they're added to the spec. This is the only Ruby implementation with full spec compliance and features like private registry support, making it useful for anyone building SBOM tools, dependency analyzers, or security scanning tools in Ruby.",
